# partycles
some mini animal-themed particle simulations!!

made with react for midnight

run in command line:
1. clone the repo and open the folder
2. cd react
3. npm run build
4. npm run dev

snake - move your mouse around to absorb the particles, your cursor becomes a snake :)

bunny - lots of random-sized bunnies appear and disappear depending on their life

bug - bugs spawn in a log shape, then they run away because you disturbed them >:(

fish - different-shaped fish particles flapping around with a few water particles as well
